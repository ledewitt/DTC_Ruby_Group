Enumerable Boolean Examples:

# Does the ARRAY include Louisiana?
>> states.include?("Colorado")
=> true
# Do all states include a space?
>> states.all? {|state| state =~ / / }
=> false
# Does any state include a space?
>> states.any? {|state| state =~ / / }
=> true
# Is there one, and only one, state with "West" in its name?
>> states.one? {|state| state =~ /West/ }
=> true
# Are there no states with "East" in their names?
>> states.none? {|state| state =~ /East/ }
=> true

--------

# Does the HASH include Louisiana?
>> states_hash.include?("Colorado")
=> true

NOTE: Only consulting the Keys not the values of the hash

>> state_hash.include?("CO")
=> false
> state_hash.values.include?("CO")
=> true

# Do all states include a space?
>> states_hash.all? {|state, abbr| state =~ / / }
=> false
# Is there one, and only one, state with "West" in its name?
>> states_hash.one? {|state, abbr| state =~ /West/ }
=> true
# Do all states include a space?
>> statess_hash.keys.all? {|state, abbr| state =~ / / }
=> false
