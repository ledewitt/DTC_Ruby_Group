Ruby's Way

In other languages, collections don’t contain their own iterators.

Instead, they implement methods that generate external helper objects (for example, those based on Java’s Iterator interface) that carry the iterator state.  

In this, as in many other ways, Ruby is a transparent
language.

When you write a Ruby program, you concentrate on getting the job done, not on building scaffolding to support the language itself.
